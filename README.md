# CIS 560 Team 13 Final Project
The following image is an image of our solution explorer, which will be used to describe where to find certain parts of our code

![Solution Explorer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9633a95-8d15-48cf-93fc-5bda7bc625fe)

Our **create tables**, **create database**, and **drop tables** SQL files can be found in the DataAccess/Tables folder.

All of the **data that we used to populate these tables** when the application is first launched can be found in the DataAccess/Data folder.

The DataAccess/Models folder contains all of the **models** we used in our code that was populated from the tables.

The DataAccess/Queries folder contains static variables of all of the **SQL** that was used to perform **CRUD opertaions on the tables**.

The DataAccess/Repositories folder contains all of the C# code that was used to perform CRUD operations on the tables using the
models that we have created. These act as a bridge between the models and queries.

The code we use to initialize the database the first time a user runs our application is store in Web App/Services.

Finally, all of the pages of our Web App are stored in Web App/Pages
